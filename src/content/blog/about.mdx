I am Vinícius Kappke, a passionate tech enthusiast and a self-taught
software engineer based in Brazil.

My story began in 2016, when I was only 12 years old and got introduced to
robotics through my school's extra-curricular activities. Since then, I have
participated and achieved many prizes in programming competitions and other
related events.

Since then, my passion has never stopped growing, and I pursued many paths
throughout this journey, from task automation and game development to web
development and UI/UX design.

As of today, I am working as a software developer with expertise in
front-end development and web design, in many projects to enhance the daily
life of food companies and their customers.
